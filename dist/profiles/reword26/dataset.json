The motivation for this new dataset is that existing datasets such as Rubinstein and Goodenough (R&G, Miller and Charles (M&C) and Word-353,  contain couples of entities such as Car-Automobile or Stock-Market and miss couples of more specific entities such as Android-Linux.\n\nHere are reported the 26 couples along with the scores provided by 20 Computer Science Master students normalized between 0 and 1.",
