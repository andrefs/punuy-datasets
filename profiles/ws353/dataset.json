  "originalInstructions": "Estimation of word similarity \n-----------------------------\n\n\nHello,\n\nWe kindly ask you to assist us in a psycholinguistic experiment, \naimed at estimating the similarity of various words in the English \nlanguage. The purpose of this experiment is to assign similarity scores \nto pairs of words, so that machine learning algorithms can be \nsubsequently trained and adjusted using human-assigned scores.\n\nBelow is a list of pairs of words. For each pair, please assign \na numerical similarity score between 0 and 10 (0 = words are totally \nunrelated, 10 = words are VERY closely related). By definition, \nthe similarity of the word to itself should be 10. You may assign \nfractional scores (for example, 7.5).\n\nSpecific instructions:\n\n1) The questionnaire starts on the next page.\n2) Please fill in your full name at the beginning of the questionnaire. \n   We need the names to ensure individual estimations do not get mixed, \n   and to be able to contact you should any clarifications become necessary.\n3) Please fill in the similarity scores in the appropriate column of \n   the table. To facilitate processing your questionnaire, please do not \n   print the document but rather type in the values in the table provided.\n4) If you do not know the meaning of a particular word - please use \n   a dictionary, or ask a native English speaker.\n5) Please DO NOT consult your friends on assigning the similarity scores  \n   it is highly important that the scores you assign be independent of \n   someone elses assessment.\n6) When estimating similarity of antonyms, consider them \"similar\"\n   (i.e., belonging to the same domain or representing features of the same \n   concept), rather than \"dissimilar\".\n\nIf you have any questions or require further clarifications (or if you \nhave a suggestion), please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nThank you for your assistance !\n\n"
