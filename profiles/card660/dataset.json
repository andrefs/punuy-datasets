    "description": "Card-660 is a challenging, yet reliable, benchmark for the evaluation of subword and rare word representation techniques. The dataset provides multiple advantages over existing benchmarks, including a very high inter-annotator agreement (IAA) of around 0.90, which is substantially higher than that for existing rare word datasets (Stanford Rare Word Similarity, with an estimated IAA of 0.41).",
